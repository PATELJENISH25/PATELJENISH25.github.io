            <p>This aromatic vegetable biryani is a classic Indian dish made with basmati rice, mixed vegetables, and a blend of spices. It's perfect for a hearty vegetarian meal.</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Basmati rice, mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, potatoes), onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, garam masala, saffron, nuts, raisins, oil</p>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> start by rinsing the rice under cold water until it runs clear, then soak it in water for 30 minutes. In a large pot over medium heat, heat ghee and sauté whole spices until fragrant. Add sliced onions and cook until golden brown, then add ginger-garlic paste and sauté until the raw smell disappears. Next, add chopped vegetables and cook until they begin to soften. Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pot, gently stirring to combine with the vegetables. Pour in water or vegetable broth, season with salt to taste, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let simmer until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. Garnish with chopped cilantro and fried onions, then serve hot with raita or yogurt on the side. Enjoy your flavorful Vegetable Biryani!</p>
